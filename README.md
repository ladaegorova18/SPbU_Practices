# üçù Forks and Philosophers üçù

The repository is dedicated to the practical problem of implementation, which was written during my studies at Saint-Petersburg State University.

## The problem formulation (also available on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dining_philosophers_problem)):

- There are 5 philosophers sitting around a round table. Each of them has a plate of spaghetti.
- There are five forks placed between each plate, one between each pair of plates.
- The philosophers are hungry.
- Each of them needed two forks to eat because it is spaghetti.
- The philosophers also needed to think about their thoughts.

So, a philosopher must wait until his neighbor finishes his dish, and then they can take the fork. 
The goal is to develop an algorithm that will allow all philosophers to alternate between eating and thinking.

It is a classic problem of synchronization that has been solved many times. One of the solutions is demonstrated here.
